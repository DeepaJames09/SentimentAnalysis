# SentimentAnalysis

Text mining is the methodical process of extracting subjective information from text data, which offers significant insights into public opinion and sentiment toward products, services, or experiences. This project involves analysing Amazon Product Reviews, each labelled with sentiment annotations, to reveal the underlying feelings represented in user comments.
The goal is to utilize a range of machine learning methods to examine the dataset, identify trends in sentiment, and construct models that can effectively classify feelings in reviews that have not been seen before. Through utilizing this analysis, our objective is to reveal insights regarding influential factors of sentiment, assisting businesses, marketers, and decision-makers in comprehending consumer perceptions and formulating well-informed strategic selections. This project aims to utilize exploratory data analysis, modelling, and visualization techniques to uncover concealed sentiment patterns within product reviews. The objective is to provide practical insights for businesses and researchers in various fields.
